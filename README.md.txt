# MakeUofT-Makeathon

This project incorporates techniques in breadboarding, and software/hardware integration using the Arduino UNO kit.

The main purpose of this system is to regulate traffic lights in a scanned environment. This aims to increase efficieny for both pedestrians and drivers, where ultrasonic technology is used in order to calculate optimal waiting/driving times for both parties. This breadboard implmentation aims to provide a working basis of both features working in conjunction.

The Arduino UNO is used here, along with an assortment of 220 ohm resistors to regulate the sequential light control of a traffic intersection. 
The Ultrasonic sensor is used to measure the distance of an oncoming pedestrian. At the approximate time of the pedestrian finishing their crossing path, the traffic lights will resume their usual blinking pattern.
